            <h2>Overview</h2>

            <q>We travel not just to travel and marvel at people, places, things. That’s not just it.
                     That was never just it for us. We travel to learn, to experience,
                      and to feel all the spectrums of being human in this world.</q>

            <p>We all have our reasons for traveling: wanderlust, the love of a different culture, a desire to just leave
                 it all behind, the need to forget, or a want to meet new people. Travel becomes a way for people to deal
                  with different situations, experience new things, or help search for a sense of self.</p>

             <p>St. Augustine once said,
                 <q>The world is a book, and he who doesn’t travel reads only one page.</q>
             </p>
            
            <p>In the book of the world, all the pages are different. Everything is new, everything is changing. Whether
                 you’re going to see a pyramid or experience a new culture, whether you are going to get away or to learn,
                  and whether you go for a month or a year, we all go because we seek change. We seek something different.
                   A change of self, attitude, daily routine, or impressions of another culture, change is the one thing
                    travel brings us.</p>

            <p>The constant change creates a chance for us to come to terms with the world around us and find out who we
                 are.</p>
            
            <p>In this modern world of  9-to-5, mortgages, carpools, and bills, our days can get pretty regimented. 
                Under the weight of mindlessly moving from day to day, we often lose track of what’s important to us and
                 what our goals are. We get so caught between commutes and errands or driving the kids to soccer, 
                 that we forget how to breathe and smell those roses.</p>
            
            <p>Out in the sea of freedom, with no compass to guide us, with nothing to force our direction, we all sail
                 onward.</p>
