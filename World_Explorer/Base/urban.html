            <h2>Luxury's Range</h2>
            <p>Highly subjective and constantly evolving, luxury travel is increasingly becoming harder to define,
                 as it continues to adapt to the changes in our society, culture, and technology. It all depends
                 on what and where you want. Regardless to the place you belongs to or  visiting another place,
                  luxury is available everywhere.

                    forming the base for everything. See below for our selection of the ultimate luxury experiences in India.</p>
